# Intelligent-Intrusion-Prevention-System
_An Intrusion Prevention System with Machine Learning capabilities to tackle previously unknown intrusions and malwares._

In the first phase, objectives and goals of the project were identified as Network Intrusion Prevention, Malware Detection, Web Application Firewall and Version Control for log files. The main aim is to come up with a security system that can identify unforeseen threats and handle them while self-updating itself to keep up with current trends.

Literature Review was conducted after that to analyse the gaps in the already existing literature and exploit those limitations to better our system. There was not much literature on prevention systems. The existing systems were mostly trained on outdated datasets which is not feasible for the current situation. 

A methodology was proposed to develop a novel system, trained on open-source datasets using a self-updating learning algorithm. We aim to make the system user-friendly by providing an admin panel for user interaction. One of the primary goals is also to minimise the False Positive and True Negative Rates, in order to make it more efficient.
